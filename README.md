NXAPI SCRIPTS
=============

A collection of Python scripts that leverage NXAPI to automate some common
(and maybe some not-so-common) tasks.

 - nxapi_core.py - A file with importable classes and more generic functions that can be used in many different scripts.

 - IntfLabel.py - A script that will pull CDP and port-channel information and label interfaces accordingly.

 -  ClearDesc.py - A short script to clear all interfaces on a 9396PX of descriptions.  Used when testing the IntfLabel.py script.

 - ipaddress.py - The py2-ipaddress module provided by Google.  Included here since it is used in these scripts.  Can be found at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/py2-ipaddress/
